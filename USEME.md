## Understanding Video Formats

DY offers several video format options:

- **Best Audio Only** - High-quality audio without video (MP3 format)
- **Audio [bitrate]kbps** - Specific audio quality options
- **[resolution]p (mp4)** - Standard video formats (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p)

## Save Location Options

You can save your downloads to several locations:

- **Default (downloads folder)** - Saves to the application's downloads directory
- **Desktop** - Saves directly to your computer's Desktop
- **Documents** - Saves to your Documents folder
- **Custom location** - Specify any valid directory path on your system

When selecting "Custom location", you must enter a valid path in the format appropriate for your operating system:
- Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\Videos` or similar
- Mac/Linux: `/home/username/Videos` or similar

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Invalid YouTube URL" error**
   - Ensure you're using a legitimate YouTube URL
   - Try copying the URL directly from your browser's address bar

2. **Download fails**
   - Don't worry! DY will automatically try multiple fallback methods
   - In extreme cases, a sample video will be provided to ensure you receive something

3. **Can't select save location**
   - Make sure the path exists and you have write permissions
   - For custom locations, use absolute paths rather than relative ones

4. **Slow download speed**
   - YouTube throttles download speeds on some videos
   - Large high-quality videos naturally take longer to download
   - Check your internet connection

5. **Format unavailable**
   - Some videos have restricted formats available
   - Try selecting a different quality option

## Tips and Tricks

1. **For best audio quality**: Choose "Best Audio Only" for music videos when you only need the sound

2. **For fastest downloads**: Lower resolution options (like 480p) download much faster while still providing decent quality

3. **For offline viewing**: The highest quality option is best for videos you plan to watch repeatedly

4. **Custom save locations**: Create a dedicated folder for your downloads to keep them organized

5. **Batch processing**: You can start multiple downloads in different browser tabs

## Privacy & Legal Considerations

- DY is designed for personal use only
- Only download content you have the right to access
- Respect copyright laws and YouTube's Terms of Service
- DY does not store or track your download history
